# Embedding Interactive Reports in Confluence

This guide explains how to embed the interactive HTML reports generated from the Log Analyzer into Confluence.

## Step 1: Generate the Interactive Report

1. Load your log file in the Log Analyzer application
2. Click the "Generate HTML Report" button
3. Configure the report options as needed
4. Save the generated HTML file to your computer

## Step 2: Upload the HTML File to Confluence

1. In your Confluence page, click "Edit"
2. Position your cursor where you want to embed the report
3. Click the "+" button to add content
4. Select "Other macros" or search for "HTML"
5. Choose the "HTML" macro from the list

## Step 3: Configure the HTML Macro

1. In the HTML macro configuration dialog, select "Attachment"
2. Click "Upload" and select the HTML report file you generated
3. Set these recommended settings:
   - **Width**: Set to 100% for responsive display
   - **Height**: Set to at least 800px (adjust as needed)
   - **Frame border**: Uncheck to remove the border
   - **Scrollbars**: Set to "When needed"

## Step 4: Save and Publish

1. Click "Insert" to add the HTML macro
2. Click "Save" to update your Confluence page
3. The interactive report will now be embedded in your page

## Troubleshooting

If the interactive elements (tooltips, chart interactions) don't work in Confluence:

1. Check your Confluence instance's Content Security Policy (CSP) settings
2. Make sure the HTML file is properly attached to the page
3. Try adjusting the iframe height to ensure the entire report is visible

## Notes for Confluence Administrators

The HTML files generated by this tool are self-contained and use only JavaScript that runs within the HTML macro's iframe. They do not make external requests or modify Confluence page content outside the iframe.
